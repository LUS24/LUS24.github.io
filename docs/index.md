# About me

Hi, my name is Leo and I'm a Pharmacist and Biochemist that switched careers to Data Science and Python development. I worked as a laboratory assistant in a research group specialized in environmental chemistry. During that time I collaborated by taking marine sediments samples from Antarctica and analyzing the resulting data using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). I collaborated with other research groups to design experiments related to plan biotechnology and analyze the data from those experiments. After learning [Python](https://www.python.org/), I started working on other projects where I used [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/) to automate data gathering from websites and storing the data in [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database running locally with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). I created a web app using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) where users can upload their datasets and share them with other peers.
